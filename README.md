# Legends of Valheim Modpack

You must have this modpack installed on your client in order to play on the Legends of Valheim server.

_**NOTE** (!!): People playing single-player may wish to continue playing on (the server-incompatible) v1.0.3. The latest update (v1.1.x) is to allow us to build the pack with server-compatibility from here._

## Player-based Economy
One of the most noticeable features of our server is a [thriving economy](https://youtu.be/DgepWl0stHA) where people trade services and goods for mutual benefit. To ensure a fair economy, we have server-side characters that makes it impossible for players to server-hop and bring resources in from other worlds. The [Better Trader](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Menthus/Better_Trader/) mod is carefully balanced to ensure there are no exploits, and it doesn't get in the way of a player-based economy. It will almost always be more beneficial to trade with a player than with Haldor.

## Land Ownership and Purchasable Zone Effects
Using the mod [World of Valheim - Zones](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/891), we can section off areas of the map and define ownership and features that only apply to that section. You can now buy land from the government and request certain effects to take place on this land, for a price that then goes to the Treasury to be spent on communal projects/prizes/whatever.

For example, Emrik has purchased a 500x500 area around _Maria Mountains_ where there is No Build Damage for 3,151 gold, meaning his castle is safe from the drakes constantly trying to get in. And Elfine has bought a 500x500 land area in the Deep North for 4,751 gold where no one else can build, open doors or chests, or damage his structures. The pricing for land and features can be found in the Discord channel.

You cannot purchase land on the starting continent, nor can you evict players who have already built on a land before you purchased it. If you find a way to abuse this system before we're able notice it, we might just put you in jail for a time, or exile you. :P

## PvP
We've built a communal Arena on _Brosandi Island_ south of the starting continent where players regularly engage in duels or [team-vs-team](https://youtu.be/7X8AhNOnJU4), and the armory is stocked to allow for up to 5-vs-5 with equal equipment. We have some mods in place to make the PVP experience more enjoyable.

* [Fight Club](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/223) enables duels without risk of death. Challenge someone with K, and they can accept with L, and then whoever is about to die will be reset to 1 hp and the winner is announced on the screen.
* [Better Archery](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/348) just makes everything about using a bow more enjoyable. Vanilla bow aim is just ridiculous.
* [Combat Stance](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/211) lets you turn to where you're pointing while wielding a weapon. Useful for blocking in the right direction without having to move.
* [First Person View](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/44) lets you zoom all the way into first-person view.
* [1-Key Dodge](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/424?tab=posts) lets you dodge with one key, set by you. You can still dodge as normal if you prefer that.
* [Let Me Eat](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Menthus/Let_Me_Eat/) lets us sync eating before Arena fights without having to wait for us to all get hungry.
* [TargetPractice](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1246) for nice aesthetic improvements and for archery competitions.
* [Fortify Skills](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/172). For team-vs-team, we can't use the Fight Club thing. So Fortify Skills has been installed so that your skills won't be completely obliterated if you like to engage in frequent pvp fights. The mod is explained further down in the mod list.
* Also patched and recompiled Fortify Skills to include a config that disables skill loss on death with PVP enabled. Should make the arena safe, even in team-vs-team battles! :D

![Baldur and Alitoma fighting in the Brosandi Arena](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51308297184_ee515909ef_b.jpg)

Zones has also been used to enforce PVP-enabled inside the Arena (and NoBuildDamage), so that people don't accidentally start fighting without PVP enabled.

## Things to note while playing on the server
* Workbenches, forges, furnaces, smelters, blast furnaces, fermenters, beehives and spinning wheels all pull from and deposit into nearby chests. This means that when you are in a workbench close to _someone else's_ storage, you might accidentally be stealing materials from their storage unless you already have the required materials in your inventory. If you've been given permission to use someone's workbench, just make sure you have the required materials for what you want to craft in your inventory before using it.
* You can press F4 to see the mod config menu, where you can customise your hud, map, keybinds, etc. to your liking. You can also use F3 to hide your hud for screenshots.
* Be a nice person and try to make it enjoyable for people to play with you! :)

## How to install

If you prefer video, here's a [quick how-to](https://youtu.be/eh_osC1R_6U).

* Download and install [r2modman](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/) (Thunderstore Mod Manager works the same, but this one is simpler.)
* After it's installed, open the manager and create a new profile. Name it "Legends of Valheim" or whatever you prefer.
* Search the online mods for "Legends of Valheim Modpack", click "Install" and select "Download with dependencies".

Active mods should now be _BepInExPack_Valheim_, _HookGenPatcher_, _Jotunn_ and _Legends_of_Valheim_Modpack_. You are now ready to join the server! Just click _Start modded_ in the top-left corner of the r2modman manager (or the mod manager of your choice).

## TODO

* Biome overhauls in the Mistlands, Deep North and the Ashlands. New monsters and drops!
* Add backpacks that cannot be exploited (unlike BackpackRedux) with custom meshes. Emrik is working hard on it!
* Find a way to ensure that when you die in a team-vs-team pvp fight, your skills won't decrease. We don't want to _disincentivise_ having fun with pvp!

## Changelog

### 1.1.2 - PVP Improvements and Cartography

TODO:
* TEST whether we can remove ExtendedDaytime, and it still work on server. Nope.
* Replace ExtendedDaytime with something else!

SERVER TODO:
* Add Cartography skill mod, because it can enforce server-side configs unto clients.
  
  
* Patched and recompiled Fortify Skills to include a config that disables skill loss on death with PVP enabled. Should make the arena safe, even in team-vs-team battles! :D
* Corrected default keybinds for Challenge (K) and Accept Challenge (L) in Fight Club mod.
* Corrected default keybind for hiding all pins on the map to F9 since F7 was already taken by BetterUI.
* Open the configuration manager with F4 instead of F1, since Advanced Build Mode (Valheim Plus) is already on F1.
* Added [Let Me Eat](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Menthus/Let_Me_Eat/) so that we can sync eating before Arena fights without having to wait for us to all get hungry.
* Added [1-Key Dodge](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/424?tab=posts), which by default is set to Mouse4. You can customise it in config menu by pressing F4.
* Added [TargetPractice](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1246) so that we can do archery competitions and just decorate arenas and training areas better (like Vino's Jungle Gym!).
* Added [Customizable Camera](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/396), which adds ways to improve camera including aiming. (Better Archery didn't have the configs to adjust aim as precisely).
* Right-click while aiming with a bow in order to focus (zoom in and reduce mouse sensitivity). (Customizable Camera configs.)
* Disabled Better Archery zoom section, because Customizable Camera deals with that much better.
* Adjusted Customizable Camera and Better Archery so that aiming is as close to perfect as possible. (By Odin's beard this took a long time!
* Added [Cartography Skill and Spyglass](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Advize/CartographySkill/) which increases the map explore radius the higher your level is.
* Added [SkillInjector](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/pipakin/SkillInjector/) because it is a dependency for all skill-introducing mods like Cartography.
* Updated TransparentSails to v1.1.1.
* Added [Useful Trophies](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Khairex/Useful_Trophies/), which enables you to consume trophies for XP in a random skill.
* Patched and recompiled _Useful Trophies_ to be server-safe and unexploitable, and increased the XP value you get from serpent trophies and rock golem trophies. Valuable commodities!
* Added [Valheim Performance Optimizations](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1360), which should increase FPS and load times, especially near the Capital.

#### 1.1.1
Had to reupload because the Thunderstore interpreter messed up the changelog section of the readme.

#### 1.1.0
(This is a complete list of all the changes that have been made to this modpack compared to the original download we had via the Discord channel.)

* Added Map Coordinate Display (client-side). Makes it much easier to figure out which area of land you want to purchase from the government.
* Added PinFilters (client-side). Press F9 to hide your map pins if you want a clear screenshot of your map.
* Added Fight Club (client-side, but the server can enforce configs). Send challenge with K and accept it with L.
* Added Combat Stance (client-side). You now turn to where you're facing while wielding a weapon. Useful for PVP and blocking in the right direction without having to move.
* Added First Person View (client-side). Lets you zoom into first-person screen. (More convenient than Valheim Plus, which requires you to press a button.)
* Custom Textures: Removed the glowing effect of Draugr fang. (The glow gets in the way while aiming...)
* Better Archery config: Set "Enable Bow Draw Movement Speed Reduction" from true to false, because this setting seemingly _can't_ be enforced via the server, so we don't want the PVP imbalance where some people have it on and some people don't.
* Better Archery config: Disabled retrievable arrows, because it didn't seem to work. Only allowed you to pick up the last arrow you shot.
* Added Configuration Manager (client-side). F4 to open client-side configs in game.
* Added Immersive HUD (client-side) and configured it to be mostly vanilla, letting the user change it if they want.
* Added BetterUI (client-side) and configured it to be mostly vanilla, leaving it up to the user to customise if they want.
* Added Remember IP (client-side). The game remembers the last IP you typed into your 'join server' field, so you don't have to type it in every time.
* Added Transparent Sails (client-side). Press H to make your ship sail transparent on your own screen, so you can more easily see where you sail. This automatically turns off when you leave the boat.
* Added Faster Crafting (client-side). Lets you craft stuff faster. (Useful if you're spending all your days cooking mushroom soups for newcomers!)
* Added Instant Monster Drop (client-side). Monsters now instantly pof and drop their stuff, without you having to wait an eternity in between you kill something and loot something.
* Included Jotunn and HookGenPatcher as dependencies for this modpack because they are dependencies for Transparent Sail and a bunch of things we might like to add in future like the backpacks.
* Added Farm Grid (client-side). The game now helps you avoid planting crops too close to each other, giving you the option of snapping it to a grid.
* Added CropReplant (client-side). Lets players harvest and replant a crop with the middle mouse button (must be wielding the Cultivator).
* Added Better Ladders (client-side). Makes walking on ladders way less clunky.
* Added Drop Single Item (client-side), which gives you inventory shortcuts inspired by Minecraft. Really useful if you're spending a lot of time in the Eddaheim Market spliting coin stacks for offers/purchases.
* Added Trash Items (client-side). There's a little window next to your inventory screen which lets you drop items into it to destroy them.
* Added Use Equipment in Water (client-side). Lets you use equipment (including Hammer and Hoe) in water, which saves you from the extremely frustrating process of trying to build something on the coast.
* Updated JotunnLib.
* Added Fortify Skills (client-side technically, but since we have SSC, the modified character info is saved on the server). This is especially useful to have on the server if people want to have PVP frequently without going back to level 1 in all skills.
* Added CustomContainerSizes (client-side, but won't take effect without some server configuration) and configured it to contain exactly the same container sizes that the server already has using Valheim Plus. This is to enable a fix to three bugs: the bug where equipment seems to be gone after you claim your items from your grave, the bug where the bottom row of your inventory was blanked, and the bug where the quiver from Better Archery was inaccessible.

#### 1.0.0 - 1.0.3
Contains lots of features that we're working on making compatible with the server.
_([Readme for v 1.0.3.](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/LoV/Legends_of_Valheim_Modpack/1.0.3/))_

#### 0.1.0
Old. Please update!
